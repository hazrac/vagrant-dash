# vagrant-dash

A Vagrant config and set of Puppet scripts to build out a Graphite Dashboard with StatsD and its dependencies.

## Overview

This is a Vagrant config file to spin up an Ubuntu Lucid server that is running Graphite and StatsD with all the necessary dependancies. The intended use of this VM is for development purposes.  With improvements the Puppet modules may be able to be modified to support a production build out.

In addition the configuration installs a puppet client which could be configured for regular puppet runs.

 There are definitly improvements that can be made and any controbutions are welcome.

## Configuration

First get started by installing and setting up Vagrant and Virtualbox.  More information can be found here <http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/index.html>. You'll then need to follow the Vagrant instructions to add a new box which needs the short name "dev51512", you can download the base box from here <http://hazrac.morpheus.net/lucid32-dev51512.box>.
